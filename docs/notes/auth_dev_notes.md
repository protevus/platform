# Authentication Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a basic authentication system with JWT support. The package is structured around core components similar to Laravel's Auth system but with significant differences in scope and implementation.

### Core Components

#### 1. Auth Class (`auth.dart`)
- Provides basic authentication functionality
- Implements user state management
- Handles token verification and creation
- Supports basic login/attempt operations

#### 2. Auth Engine (`auth_engine.dart`)
- Manages authentication configuration
- Implements guard system
- Handles driver and provider management
- Uses singleton pattern for global state

#### 3. JWT Driver (`jwt_auth_driver.dart`)
- Implements JWT-based authentication
- Handles token verification and creation
- Supports customizable JWT configuration
- Manages credential verification

## Feature Comparison with Laravel

### Authentication

#### Currently Implemented
- ✅ Basic authentication flow
- ✅ JWT token support
- ✅ User state management
- ✅ Basic guard system
- ✅ Provider interface
- ✅ Password hashing

#### Missing Features
1. **Multiple Authentication Guards**
   - Laravel supports multiple concurrent authentication systems
   - Need to implement guard switching
   - Support for multiple simultaneous auth states

2. **Authentication Events**
   - Login attempt events
   - Logout events
   - Authentication failure events
   - Password reset events

3. **Password Reset Functionality**
   - Password reset tokens
   - Password reset flow
   - Email notification system

4. **Remember Me Functionality**
   - Long-lived authentication
   - Remember token management
   - Token rotation security

5. **Additional Auth Drivers**
   - Session-based authentication
   - Token-based authentication (non-JWT)
   - Custom driver support

### Authorization

#### Missing Features
1. **Gates**
   - Closure-based authorization
   - Before/after authorization hooks
   - Resource-based authorization

2. **Policies**
   - Model-based authorization rules
   - Policy registration system
   - Policy caching

3. **Roles and Permissions**
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission management
   - Role hierarchy

### Middleware

#### Currently Implemented
- ✅ Basic auth middleware

#### Missing Features
1. **Advanced Middleware Features**
   - Role-based middleware
   - Permission middleware
   - Guest middleware
   - Authenticated middleware variants

### User Providers

#### Missing Features
1. **Multiple User Providers**
   - Database user provider
   - Custom user provider support
   - Cache integration
   - External authentication services support

## API Compatibility

### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   auth.attempt(credentials)
   auth.verifyToken(request)
   
   // Laravel
   Auth::attempt($credentials)
   Auth::check()
   Auth::user()
   ```

2. Configuration Structure
   - Laravel uses PHP configuration files
   - Our implementation needs a more flexible configuration system

## Priority Implementation Tasks

1. High Priority
   - [ ] Implement multiple guard support
   - [ ] Add authentication events system
   - [ ] Develop password reset functionality
   - [ ] Create basic authorization system (Gates)

2. Medium Priority
   - [ ] Add remember me functionality
   - [ ] Implement additional auth drivers
   - [ ] Create role/permission system
   - [ ] Enhance middleware capabilities

3. Low Priority
   - [ ] Add policy support
   - [ ] Implement user provider variants
   - [ ] Create caching system
   - [ ] Add external auth service support

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing Coverage**
   - Need comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration tests required
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Security testing

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Security best practices
   - Configuration guide

3. **Code Organization**
   - Separate concerns more clearly
   - Better error handling
   - Consistent API design
   - More extensive use of interfaces

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**
   - Implement token rotation
   - Add refresh token support
   - Secure token storage
   - Token revocation system

2. **Password Security**
   - Password strength validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Brute force protection
   - Secure password reset flow

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions
   - Create detailed specifications for missing features
   - Set up event system infrastructure
   - Begin multiple guard implementation
   - Enhance security features

2. Future Considerations
   - OAuth integration
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Social authentication
   - Biometric authentication support

## Migration Path

1. Version 1.0
   - Complete core authentication features
   - Basic authorization system
   - Event system
   - Enhanced security features

2. Version 2.0
   - Advanced authorization features
   - Multiple authentication methods
   - External service integration
   - Complete Laravel feature parity

## Notes for Contributors

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add comprehensive tests for new features
- Update documentation with changes
- Consider backward compatibility
- Focus on security best practices
