# WebSocket Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a websocket system similar to Laravel's websocket services. The package offers websocket connections, event handling, and adapter support with a focus on scalability and real-time communication.

### Core Components

#### 1. WebSocket Server (`websocket.dart`)
- Server management
- Adapter handling
- Event creation
- Connection handling
- Singleton pattern
- Application integration

#### 2. WebSocket Adapter (`websocket_adapter.dart`)
- Event emission
- Protocol handling
- Connection management
- Interface definition
- Redis adapter support
- Abstraction layer

#### 3. Core Features
- WebSocket connections
- Event handling
- Adapter support
- Redis integration
- Event emission
- Connection management

   websocket.create()
   adapter.emit(event)
   
   // Laravel
   WebSocket::new()
   broadcast(event)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses Pusher/Socket.io
   - Our implementation uses custom adapters
