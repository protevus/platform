# Events Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides an event system similar to Laravel's event dispatcher. The package offers event dispatching, queued listeners, and subscriber support with a focus on flexibility and extensibility.

### Core Components

#### 1. Event Dispatcher (`dispatcher.dart`)
- Event registration
- Event dispatching
- Wildcard listeners
- Subscriber support
- Container integration
- Transaction handling

#### 2. Queued Listener (`queued_listener.dart`)
- Queue configuration
- Listener serialization
- Retry handling
- Middleware support
- Delay management
- Connection handling

#### 3. Core Features
- Event listening
- Event broadcasting
- Subscriber pattern
- Queue integration
- Transaction support
- Wildcard events

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   dispatcher.dispatch(event, payload)
   dispatcher.listen(event, listener)
   
   // Laravel
   Event::dispatch($event)
   Event::listen($event, $listener)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses PHP's reflection
   - Our implementation uses Dart mirrors
