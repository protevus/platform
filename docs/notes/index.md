# Package Development Roadmaps

Welcome to the development roadmaps for our Dart packages. These roadmaps provide comprehensive analyses and development plans for each package in our ecosystem, comparing our implementations with Laravel's corresponding systems.

## Purpose

These roadmaps serve multiple purposes:

1. **Feature Parity Analysis**: Detailed comparisons between our Dart implementations and Laravel's PHP implementations
2. **Development Planning**: Clear priorities and tasks for moving each package forward
3. **Technical Documentation**: Insights into current implementations and design decisions
4. **Contribution Guide**: Direction for contributors looking to help improve the packages

- [Foundation](foundation_dev_notes.md) - Core foundation package roadmap

1. **Current Implementation Analysis**
   - Overview of the current state
   - Core components
   - Implemented features

2. **Feature Comparison**
   - Currently implemented features
   - Missing features
   - API compatibility analysis

3. **Development Priorities**
   - High priority tasks
   - Medium priority tasks
   - Low priority tasks

4. **Technical Considerations**
   - Performance analysis
   - Security considerations
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation needs

5. **Migration Path**
   - Version 1.0 goals
   - Version 2.0 goals
   - Laravel feature parity targets

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to any of our packages. Each roadmap includes specific sections for contributors:

- Notes for contributors
- Testing strategies
- Documentation requirements
- Design considerations

Before contributing, please review the roadmap for your package of interest to understand:

1. Current implementation status
2. Development priorities
3. Missing features
4. Technical requirements

## Updating Roadmaps

These roadmaps are living documents that evolve with our packages. They are updated:

- When new features are implemented
- When new requirements are identified
- When Laravel introduces relevant changes
- When community feedback suggests new directions

## Getting Started

To get started with package development:

1. Choose a package from the roadmaps above
2. Review its current implementation status
3. Check the priority implementation tasks
4. Follow the contribution guidelines

For questions or suggestions about the roadmaps, please open an issue in the relevant package repository.
