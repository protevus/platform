# Storage Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a storage system similar to Laravel's storage services. The package offers file storage, streaming capabilities, and driver support with a focus on flexibility and reliability.

### Core Components

#### 1. Storage (`storage.dart`)
- File operations
- Stream handling
- Driver management
- MIME detection
- Download support
- Error handling

#### 2. Local Storage Driver (`local_storage_driver.dart`)
- File system operations
- Path sanitization
- File validation
- Directory handling
- Error handling
- MIME support

#### 3. Core Features
- File storage
- File streaming
- File downloads
- Driver support
- MIME detection
- Path handling

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation

   storage.get(filename)
   
   // Laravel
   Storage::put($path, $contents)
   Storage::get($path)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses Flysystem
   - Our implementation uses custom drivers
