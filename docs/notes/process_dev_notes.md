# Process Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a process management system similar to Laravel's process services. The package offers process execution, timeout handling, and environment management with a focus on reliability and flexibility.

### Core Components

#### 1. Process Factory (`factory.dart`)
- Process creation
- Command validation
- Instance management
- Error handling
- Type checking
- Factory patterns

#### 2. Pending Process (`pending_process.dart`)
- Process configuration
- Environment setup
- Timeout handling
- Input/Output management
- TTY support
- Error handling

#### 3. Core Features
- Process execution
- Timeout management
- Environment control
- Input handling
- Output capture
- Error handling

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   factory.command(cmd).run()
   process.withTimeout(seconds)
   
   // Laravel
   Process::run($cmd)
   Process::timeout($seconds)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses Symfony Process
   - Our implementation uses dart:io Process
