# Cache Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a basic caching system with file-based storage. The package is structured around core components similar to Laravel's Cache system but with a more limited scope in terms of drivers and features.

### Core Components

#### 1. Cache Manager (`cache.dart`)
- Store selection
- Tag support
- Driver management
- Basic cache operations
- Configuration integration

#### 2. File Driver (`file_cache_driver.dart`)
- File-based storage
- Data encryption
- TTL support
- Tag-based categorization
- JSON serialization

#### 3. Cache Interface
- Basic cache operations
- Tag management
- Store selection
- Duration handling

   - Cache warming

3. **Cache Tags**
   - Multiple tags
   - Tag flushing
   - Tag statistics
   - Tag-based queries

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limiter integration
   - Throttling support
   - Window limiting
   - Dynamic limits

### Store Management

#### Missing Features
1. **Store Features**
   - Store fallback
   - Store replication
   - Store events
   - Store health checks

2. **Store Operations**
   - Bulk operations
   - Prefix management
   - Connection pooling
   - Reconnection handling

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   cache.put(key, value, duration)
   cache.tag(name).get(key)
   
   // Laravel
   Cache::put($key, $value, $ttl)
   Cache::tags(['tag'])->get($key)
   ```

2. Configuration Structure
   - Laravel uses PHP configuration files
   - Our implementation uses runtime configuration
