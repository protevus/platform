# Bus Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a command bus system with job batching capabilities. The package is structured around core components similar to Laravel's Bus system with implementations tailored for Dart's async patterns.

### Core Components

#### 1. Dispatcher (`dispatcher.dart`)
- Handles command dispatching (sync and async)
- Supports queue resolution
- Pipeline processing
- Command-to-handler mapping
- Container integration
- Mirror-based method invocation

#### 2. Batch System (`batch.dart`)
- Job batching support
- Batch state management
- Chain execution
- Callback handling (success/error/finally)
- Progress tracking
- Cancellation support

#### 3. Job Management
- Queueable jobs
- Sync jobs
- Batch processing
- Job pruning
- Unique job locking

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   dispatcher.dispatch(command)
   dispatcher.dispatchToQueue(command)
   
   // Laravel
   Bus::dispatch($command)
   Bus::dispatchToQueue($command)
   ```

2. Configuration Structure
   - Laravel uses PHP configuration files
   - Our implementation uses runtime configuration

## Priority Implementation Tasks

1. High Priority

   - [ ] Create batch middleware
   - [ ] Add batch timeouts

3. Low Priority
   - [ ] Implement command versioning
   - [ ] Add batch archiving
   - [ ] Create batch restoration
   - [ ] Add job encryption

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing Coverage**

   - Authorization checks
   - Rate limiting

2. **Job Security**
   - Job encryption
   - Queue security
   - Batch access control
   - Error handling

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions
