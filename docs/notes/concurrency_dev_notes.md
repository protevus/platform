# Concurrency Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a robust concurrency system with multiple execution drivers and control mechanisms. The package is structured around core components that handle parallel processing, rate limiting, and resource management.

### Core Components

#### 1. Concurrency Manager (`manager.dart`)
- Driver management
- Factory registration
- Default driver handling
- Task execution
- Deferred processing

#### 2. Execution Drivers
- Isolate-based execution
- Process-based execution
- Synchronous execution
- Driver abstraction
- Resource management

#### 3. Control Mechanisms
- Rate limiting
- Mutex locking
- Throttling
- Task scheduling
- Resource protection

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   concurrency.run(() => task)
   rateLimiter.execute(() => task)
   
   // Laravel
   Bus::dispatch($job)
   RateLimiter::for('key')->attempt($callback)
   ```

2. Configuration Structure
   - Laravel uses service providers
   - Our implementation uses runtime configuration
