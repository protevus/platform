# Database Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a database abstraction layer and ORM system similar to Laravel's database and Eloquent ORM. The package offers query building, model relationships, and database schema management.

### Core Components

#### 1. Query Builder (`query_builder.dart`)
- SQL query construction
- Query execution
- Parameter binding
- Database drivers
- Query debugging
- Raw queries

#### 2. Model System (`model.dart`)
- ORM functionality
- Relationship handling
- Attribute casting
- Model events
- Timestamps
- Soft deletes

#### 3. Schema Builder (`schema.dart`)
- Table creation
- Column definitions
- Index management
- Foreign keys
- Schema modifications

#### 4. Relationships
- Has One
- Has Many
- Belongs To
- Many to Many
- Relationship loading
- Eager loading

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   Model.table('users').where('id', 1).get()
   Model.create({'name': 'John'})
   
   // Laravel
   DB::table('users')->where('id', 1)->get()
   Model::create(['name' => 'John'])
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses PHP's PDO
   - Our implementation uses database-specific drivers
