# Filesystem Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a filesystem abstraction layer similar to Laravel's filesystem system. The package offers local and cloud storage support with a focus on driver flexibility and extensibility.

### Core Components

#### 1. Filesystem (`filesystem.dart`)
- File operations
- Directory handling
- Path management
- Visibility control
- Stream support
- Error handling

#### 2. Filesystem Adapter (`filesystem_adapter.dart`)
- Cloud storage
- Driver abstraction
- Configuration handling
- URL generation
- Stream operations
- Visibility management

#### 3. Core Features
- File manipulation
- Directory operations
- Stream handling
- Visibility control
- Path normalization
- Error handling

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   filesystem.put(path, contents)
   filesystem.get(path)
   
   // Laravel
   Storage::put($path, $contents)
   Storage::get($path)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses Flysystem
   - Our implementation uses custom drivers
