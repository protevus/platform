# Queue Package Development Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Overview
Our current Dart implementation provides a queue system similar to Laravel's queue services. The package offers queue management, job processing, and driver support with a focus on reliability and extensibility.

### Core Components

#### 1. Queue Manager (`queue_manager.dart`)
- Driver registration
- Connection management
- Configuration handling
- Default drivers
- Error handling
- Factory patterns

#### 2. Redis Queue (`redis_queue.dart`)
- Job pushing
- Job popping
- Delayed jobs
- Job migration
- Queue monitoring
- Error handling

#### 3. Core Features
- Queue management
- Job processing
- Driver support
- Error handling
- Connection pooling
- Job scheduling

### API Compatibility

#### Current API Differences
1. Method Names and Signatures
   ```dart
   // Our Implementation
   queue.push(job)
   queue.later(delay, job)
   
   // Laravel
   Queue::push($job)
   Queue::later($delay, $job)
   ```

2. Implementation Structure
   - Laravel uses queue workers
   - Our implementation uses direct processing
