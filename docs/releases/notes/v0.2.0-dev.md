# Release Notes - Version 0.2.0-dev

## Overview
This development release focuses on establishing core database functionality and testing infrastructure. It introduces significant improvements to database handling, including a major refactor from PDO to DBO, and implements a comprehensive testing framework.

## Key Features
### Database Infrastructure
- Complete refactor of database objects
- Migration from PDO to DBO system
- Enhanced database interaction layer
- Improved query building capabilities
- Robust connection management

### Testing Framework
- Comprehensive test suite implementation
- Unit testing infrastructure
- Integration testing capabilities
- Test helpers and utilities
- Automated test running support

### Events System
- New events system implementation
- Event dispatching mechanism
- Event listening capabilities
- Asynchronous event handling
- Event broadcasting infrastructure

## Technical Details
### Database Refactoring
- Renamed PDO implementation to DBO for better clarity
- Enhanced database abstraction layer
- Improved query builder implementation
- Added transaction management
- Implemented connection pooling
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Testing Infrastructure
- PHPUnit-style test structure
- Assertion library implementation
- Mock object support
- Test case base classes
- Database testing utilities
- Fixture support

### Events Architecture
- Observer pattern implementation
- Event dispatcher system
- Listener registration mechanism
- Event queuing capabilities
- Synchronous and asynchronous event handling

## Impact
This release significantly enhances the platform's capabilities in:
- Database operations and management
- Quality assurance through testing
- System event handling and communication
- Code reliability and maintainability

## Breaking Changes
- PDO to DBO migration requires updates to database interaction code
- New testing framework requires test rewrites
- Events system changes may require event handler updates

## Migration Guide
### Updating from PDO to DBO
1. Update database connection strings
2. Migrate query implementations
3. Update transaction handling
4. Implement new error handling

### Implementing New Testing Framework
1. Update test class inheritance
2. Migrate to new assertion syntax
3. Update mock implementations
4. Implement new test helpers

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases in transaction handling need refinement
- Additional documentation needed for advanced testing features
- Event system performance optimization ongoing

## Installation
```bash
git checkout v0.2.0-dev
dart pub get
dart pub run test
```

## Documentation
- Updated database interaction guides
- New testing framework documentation
- Event system implementation guides
- Migration guides and examples

## Performance Improvements
- Optimized database connection handling
- Improved query execution performance
- Enhanced event dispatch efficiency
- Faster test execution

## Security Enhancements
- Improved database security measures
- Enhanced query sanitization
- Better transaction isolation
- Secure event handling

## Additional Notes
This release marks a significant step forward in the platform's development, particularly in terms of database handling, testing capabilities, and event management. The transition from PDO to DBO represents a major architectural improvement that will benefit future development.
