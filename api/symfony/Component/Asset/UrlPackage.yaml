class_comment: '# * Package that adds a base URL to asset URLs in addition to a version.

  # *

  # * The package allows to use more than one base URLs in which case

  # * it randomly chooses one for each asset; it also guarantees that

  # * any given path will always use the same base URL to be nice with

  # * HTTP caching mechanisms.

  # *

  # * When the request context is available, this package can choose the

  # * best base URL to use based on the current request scheme:

  # *

  # *  * For HTTP request, it chooses between all base URLs;

  # *  * For HTTPs requests, it chooses between HTTPs base URLs and relative protocol
  URLs

  # *    or falls back to any base URL if no secure ones are available.

  # *
