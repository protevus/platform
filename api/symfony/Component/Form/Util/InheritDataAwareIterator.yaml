name: InheritDataAwareIterator
class_comment: '# * Iterator that traverses an array of forms.

  # *

  # * Contrary to \ArrayIterator, this iterator recognizes changes in the original

  # * array during iteration.

  # *

  # * You can wrap the iterator into a {@link \RecursiveIteratorIterator} in order
  to

  # * enter any child form that inherits its parent''s data and iterate the children

  # * of that form as well.
