class_comment: '# * Stores all metadata needed for validating a class property via
  its getter

  # * method.

  # *

  # * A property getter is any method that is equal to the property''s name,

  # * prefixed with "get", "is" or "has". That method will be used to access the

  # * property''s value.

  # *

  # * The getter will be invoked by reflection, so the access of private and

  # * protected getters is supported.

  # *

  # * This class supports serialization and cloning.
