  comment: '# * Normalized spaces in date strings generated by INTL for older ICU
    versions.

    # *

    # * In version 72.1, ICU started to render a narrow non-breaking space (NNBSP)
    into localized time strings. This

    # * method allows us to write expectations in a forward-compatible manner.'
