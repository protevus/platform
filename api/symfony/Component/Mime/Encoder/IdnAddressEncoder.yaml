  comment: '# * An IDN email address encoder.

    # *

    # * Encodes the domain part of an address using IDN. This is compatible will all

    # * SMTP servers.

    # *

    # * Note: It leaves the local part as is. In case there are non-ASCII characters

    # * in the local part then it depends on the SMTP Server if this is supported.
