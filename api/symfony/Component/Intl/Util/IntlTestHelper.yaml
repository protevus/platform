class_comment: '# * Helper class for preparing test cases that rely on the Intl component.

  # *

  # * Any test that tests functionality relying on either the intl classes or

  # * the resource bundle data should call either of the methods

  # * {@link requireIntl()} or {@link requireFullIntl()}. Calling

  # * {@link requireFullIntl()} is only necessary if you use functionality in the

  # * test that is not provided by the stub intl implementation.
