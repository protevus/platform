        To expedite issue processing, please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.
        Please read our Rules of Conduct at this repository's `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

        FIRST OF ALL, read this project's SECURITY.md file. Located in `.github/SECURITY.md`.

        READ CAREFULLY IF YOUR ISSUE REPORT CONTAINS SENSIBLE OR PRIVATE DATA:
        (data that might be leaked or subtracted from our servers due to this
        security issue).

        If this security report (or the guide on how to "identify the security bug") includes
        certain personal information or involves personal identifiable data, or you believe
        that the data that you might leak by exposing the way on how to attack the project
        could be considered as a data leak or could violate the privacy of any kind of
        data or sensible data, please do not post it here and directly email the developer:
        (jgracia9988@gmail.com). You should post the issue with the least amount of
        sensible or private data as possible to help us manage the security issue, and
        with the extra data sent from your email to the developer (if any), we will deeply
        analyze and try to fix it as fast as possible.

        If you are in doubt about the data that you might post here (screenshots or media
        also, count as data), please directly email us.

        The data that must NOT be posted here:

        * Legal and/or full names
        * Names or usernames combined with other identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses
        * Health or financial information (including insurance information, social security numbers, etc.)
        * Information about political or religious affiliations
        * Information about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or other identifying information that could be used for discriminatory purposes
