/// - `base_cast.dart`: Contains base casting operations.
/// - `primitive_cast.dart`: Provides casting methods for primitive data types.
/// - `collection_cast.dart`: Offers casting utilities for collections.
/// - `special_cast.dart`: Includes casting operations for special data types.
/// - `utility_cast.dart`: Contains additional utility functions for casting.
/// - `constants.dart`: Defines constants used across the casting operations.
///
/// These modules collectively provide a comprehensive set of tools for handling
/// various type conversion scenarios in Dart applications.
