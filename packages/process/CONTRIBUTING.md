    test('executes command successfully', () async {
      factory.fake({
        'test-command': FakeProcessDescription()
          ..withExitCode(0)
          ..replaceOutput('Test output'),
      });

      final result = await factory
          .command('test-command')
          .run();

      expect(result.successful(), isTrue);
      expect(result.output(), equals('Test output'));
