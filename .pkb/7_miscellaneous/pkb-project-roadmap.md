# Protevus Roadmap

The Protevus project follows an iterative development approach, with a roadmap divided into several phases and milestones. This roadmap serves as a guide for the development and evolution of the Protevus platform, outlining the planned features, improvements, and goals for each phase.

It's important to note that this roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, emerging requirements, and the evolving landscape of the Dart ecosystem. The project team will regularly review and update the roadmap to ensure it aligns with the project's vision and priorities.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Components

**Milestones:**
- Refactor and integrate the ported Illuminate contract libraries and Symfony supporting classes into the Protevus platform codebase.
- Establish the modular architecture, separating core platform components from specific application implementations.
- Define coding standards, best practices, and development workflows for the Protevus platform.
- Set up continuous integration, testing, and deployment pipelines.

## Phase 2: Laravel API Compatibility

**Milestones:**
- Prioritize and port the essential Laravel components and features required for API compatibility, such as routing, controllers, middleware, and request/response handling.
- Adapt and integrate the ported components into the Protevus platform architecture.
- Implement compatibility layers or adapters to ensure seamless integration with the Laravel API.
- Conduct extensive testing and validation to ensure API compatibility and adherence to Laravel's conventions and behaviors.

## Phase 3: Documentation and Community Engagement

**Milestones:**
- Adapt and integrate relevant portions of Laravel's documentation into the Protevus platform, updating code examples to Dart syntax.
- Develop supplementary documentation for platform-specific features and configurations.
- Establish contribution guidelines and processes for community involvement.
- Launch the Protevus website, social media channels, and community forums.
- Engage with the Dart community, promote the project, and encourage contributions.

## Phase 4: Refactoring and Integration

**Milestones:**
- Review and assess features and components from other Dart server frameworks like Angel3, Serverpod, and Vania.
- Refactor and integrate useful features and proven implementations into the Protevus platform.
- Ensure proper documentation, testing, and compatibility with the existing Protevus codebase.
- Collaborate with the respective framework communities to foster knowledge sharing and potential contributions.

## Phase 5: Dart-FIG and Ecosystem Integration

**Milestones:**
- Establish the Dart-FIG (Dart Framework Interoperability Group) and define its governance structure and operating principles.
- Adapt and implement concepts like autoloading, dependency injection, and interface-based programming from the PHP-FIG to the Dart ecosystem.
- Collaborate with the Dart community and other framework authors to promote the adoption of Dart-FIG standards.
- Integrate the Protevus platform with other Dart libraries, tools, and ecosystem components, ensuring interoperability and compatibility.

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization and Scaling

**Milestones:**
- Conduct performance profiling and optimization efforts to ensure the Protevus platform leverages the full potential of Conduit's multi-threaded architecture.
- Implement caching mechanisms, load balancing, and other scaling strategies to handle diverse workloads and high-traffic scenarios.
- Explore opportunities for parallelization and asynchronous processing to further enhance performance.

## Phase 7: Additional Framework Support and Extensibility

**Milestones:**
- Assess the feasibility and demand for supporting other popular frameworks like Codeigniter within the Protevus platform.
- Develop compatibility layers, adapters, or dedicated modules to enable support for additional frameworks.
- Enhance the platform's extensibility and modularity to accommodate diverse use cases and custom extensions.

## Phase 8: Continuous Improvement and Maintenance

**Milestones:**
- Establish processes for regularly reviewing and incorporating updates from Laravel and other integrated frameworks.
- Continuously improve the developer experience, tooling, and debugging capabilities of the Protevus platform.
- Foster an active community of contributors and maintainers to ensure the long-term sustainability and evolution of the project.

This roadmap outlines the planned phases and milestones for the Protevus project. However, it's important to note that this is a living document and may be updated as the project progresses and new requirements or priorities emerge.

The Protevus team encourages community feedback and involvement throughout the development process. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or concerns regarding the roadmap, please share them through the appropriate channels (e.g., GitHub discussions, forums, or community meetings).

Together, we can shape the future of the Protevus platform and create a powerful and versatile application server that empowers developers in the Dart ecosystem.
