# Protevus Platform Development Workflow

To ensure consistency and efficiency during the development process, the Protevus Platform follows a specific workflow. This document outlines the steps and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Branching Strategy

When contributing to the project, it is important to create a new branch for the specific feature or task you are working on. This helps to keep the main branch clean and prevents any conflicts or issues with the existing code.

To create a new branch, use the following command:

~~~bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
~~~

Replace `<branch-name>` with a meaningful name that describes the feature or task you are working on. For example:

~~~bash
git checkout -b feature/new-view
~~~

or

~~~bash
git checkout -b feature/refactor-view
~~~

Once you have created the new branch, you can start working on the feature or task.

## Committing Changes

When you have made the necessary changes, you should commit them to the new branch. To commit the changes, use the following command:

~~~bash
git commit -m "Description of the commit"
~~~

Replace `Description of the commit` with a meaningful description of the changes you have made. For example:

~~~bash
git commit -m "Refactored the view to use the new design"
~~~

or

~~~bash
git commit -m "Added the new view for the design"
~~~

It is important to provide a clear and concise description of the changes you have made, as this will help others understand the purpose of the commit.

## Pushing Changes

Once you have committed the changes, you should push the new branch to the remote repository. To do this, use the following command:

~~~bash
git push -u origin <branch_name>
~~~

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier. This command will push the new branch to the remote repository and set the upstream branch for the current branch.

After pushing the changes, you can continue working on the feature or task. Once you have completed the work, you can create a pull request for review and merging.

## Continuing Development

Once you have completed the work on the feature or task, you can continue working on other features or tasks by creating a new branch for each one. This will help to keep the main branch clean and prevent any conflicts or issues with the existing code.

To create a new branch, use the following command:

~~~bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
~~~

Replace `<branch-name>` with a meaningful name for the new feature or task you are working on.

This workflow helps to keep the code organized and prevents any conflicts or issues with the existing code. It also allows you to work on multiple features or tasks simultaneously without affecting the existing code.

## Merging Changes

Once you have completed the work on the feature or task, you can create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch. The maintainers of the project will review the changes and merge them into the main branch.

To create a pull request, use the following command:

~~~bash
git pull-request
~~~

This command will prompt you to enter the details of the pull request, such as the branch name and the commit message. Once you have entered the details, the pull request will be created and the maintainers will be notified of the changes.

After the changes have been merged, you can continue working on other features or tasks by creating a new branch and repeating the process.

## Conclusion

By following this workflow, you can contribute to the project without affecting the existing code. The new branch allows you to work on the feature or task without affecting the existing code, and the commit message provides a clear description of the changes you have made.

Once you have completed the work, you can create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch. The maintainers of the project will review the changes and merge them into the main branch.

This workflow helps to keep the code organized and prevents any conflicts or issues with the existing code. It also allows you to work on multiple features or tasks simultaneously without affecting the existing code.

By following this workflow, you can contribute to the project without affecting the existing code and without causing any conflicts or issues with the existing code.
