    ~~~bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ~~~

5. **Make Changes**: Make the desired changes to the codebase, following the project's coding conventions and best practices.

6. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes do not introduce any regressions by running the project's test suite. If you're introducing new functionality, please include appropriate tests.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Follow the Coding Style**: Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding style and conventions. We follow the [Dart Style Guide](link-to-dart-style-guide) and use tools like `dartfmt` and `dartanalyzer` to maintain consistent code formatting and style.

- **Write Tests**: We value well-tested code. If you're introducing new functionality or fixing a bug, please include appropriate tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the codebase.

- **Document Your Changes**: If your contribution involves changes to the codebase or introduces new features, please update the relevant documentation accordingly.

- **Keep It Small**: Try to keep your contributions focused and manageable. If you're working on a larger feature or refactoring, consider breaking it down into smaller, incremental changes to facilitate the review process.

- **Be Responsive**: Be prepared to engage in discussions and address any feedback or questions raised during the review process. We strive to maintain an open and collaborative environment.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, issues, or have feature requests, please report them in the appropriate repository's [issue tracker](link-to-issue-tracker). When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem, expected behavior, and any relevant error messages or logs.
