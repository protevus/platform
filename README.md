# Fabric Framework

Welcome to the Fabric Framework, a comprehensive port of Laravel's Illuminate components to Dart. Fabric aims to provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich framework for building modern web applications using Dart.

## Overview

Fabric is designed to mirror Laravel's Illuminate components, ensuring a familiar structure for developers accustomed to Laravel while leveraging Dart's modern language features. The framework consists of various packages that collectively offer a complete solution for web development.

## Goals

1. **Maintain Laravel's Structure:** Keep the directory and component structure identical to Laravel, but adhere to Dart best practices.
2. **Ensure Modularity:** Port each Illuminate component as a separate Dart package for modular usage.
3. **Enable Rapid Development:** Provide a running base application quickly to facilitate real-time testing and development.

## Key Features

- **Modular Packages:** Each Illuminate component is available as a standalone Dart package.
- **Comprehensive Routing:** Powerful routing capabilities inspired by Laravel.
- **Dependency Injection:** Built-in support for dependency injection to promote loose coupling.
- **Middleware Support:** Use middleware for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust tools for user authentication and authorization.
- **Database Abstraction:** Database-agnostic query builder and ORM.
- **Queueing System:** Manage background tasks and queues.
- **Event Broadcasting:** Real-time event broadcasting for modern applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Dart 3.0 or higher
- A basic understanding of Dart and Laravel

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash

### Usage

Fabric is structured to be as familiar as possible to Laravel developers. Here’s a quick example of setting up a simple application:

1. **Create a New Dart File:**

    ```dart
    import 'package:fabric/fabric.dart';

    void main() {
      final app = Application();

      app.get('/', (Request req) {
        return Response.ok('Hello, World!');
      });

      app.run();
    }
    ```

2. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    dart run
    ```
