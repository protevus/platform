# Protevus Platform Resources

This directory contains various static resources used throughout the Protevus Platform. These resources include images, icons, and other assets that contribute to the platform's visual and functional elements.

## Directory Structure

```
resources/
├── images/
│   ├── logos/
│   ├── backgrounds/
│   └── icons/
├── fonts/
├── locales/
└── templates/
```

### images/

This directory contains all image assets used in the Protevus Platform.

- `logos/`: Contains logo variations for the platform and potentially partner logos.
- `backgrounds/`: Includes background images used in the UI.
- `icons/`: Houses individual icon files used throughout the platform.

### fonts/

The fonts/ directory contains custom font files used in the Protevus Platform UI. This ensures consistent typography across different environments.

### locales/

This directory contains localization files for internationalization (i18n) support. Each supported language should have its own subdirectory or file.

### templates/

The templates/ directory houses reusable UI templates or snippets that can be used across different parts of the platform.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Maintain a consistent naming convention for all resources (e.g., kebab-case for image files).
2. Optimize images for web use to ensure fast loading times.
3. Use SVG format for icons and logos where possible for better scalability.
4. Keep font files in web-friendly formats (e.g., WOFF2, WOFF).
5. Organize localization files in a structured manner, using standard formats like JSON or YAML.

## Adding New Resources

When adding new resources:

1. Place the resource in the appropriate subdirectory.
2. Ensure the resource doesn't duplicate existing ones.
3. For images and icons, provide both regular and high-DPI (@2x, @3x) versions if applicable.
4. Update any relevant asset manifests or indexes.

## Updating Existing Resources

When updating resources:

1. Maintain backwards compatibility where possible.
2. Update all relevant sizes/versions of the resource.
3. If replacing a resource, ensure it's not being used elsewhere in the platform before removing the old version.

## Contributing

When contributing new resources:

1. Ensure all assets are properly licensed for use in the Protevus Platform.
2. Optimize assets for web use before committing.
3. Update documentation if adding new types of resources or changing existing structures.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the new or updated resources.
